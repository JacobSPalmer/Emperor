### For Mac Users:

For Mac users, Mac prevents unregistered apps to be launched. The app contains a workaround to get around this but will throw a security pop-up on initial launch. When launching the game for the first time, it will tell you it cannot be opened. Go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy and then click Open Anyways on the prompt regarding the game. This should allow you to run it freely now. It might also ask for permission to write to your documents file, this is solely for to log the database file for the leaderboard! 

## .NET Framework/Unity Version:

The build is currently created using Unity 2019.4.21f1 and utilizes .NET 2.0 framework
